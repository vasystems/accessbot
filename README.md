# Notice
From 26th September 2024, the API endpoint that this bot uses has been closed. vAMSYS now offer thier own Access bot that can be used instead, details are at https://docs.vamsys.dev

# Access Bot
This is a bot specifically designed for the purpose of handling Discord access requests for vAMSYS virtual airlines.

## Configuration
To configure this bot, a `config` folder needs to be made in the root directory that contains the `src`, `index.js` and `README.md` files with the following file:

### config.json
```js
{
  "airlineID": "", // prefix for pilot ID usernames in the serve
  "vamsysKey": "", // 'abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz012345'
  "discordToken": "", // Discord bot token
  "servers": {
    "012345678901234567": { // set to the guild ID
      "accessRoleId": ["012345678901234567"], // snowflake for the role that should be assigned to users that have requested access - comma separate roles for multiple roles to be assigned (eg. ["012345678901234567", "765432109876543210"])
      "nickSeparator": " - ", // the separator that should be used between the name and pilot ID in nicknames
      "roleRemoval": { // section for configuration of the removal of role(s) when a pilot joins a server
        "enabled": true, // set this to true if a role needs to be removed when a user is given access to the server, and false if not
        "roleId": ["012345678901234567"] // if role removal is enabled above, set this to the snowflake of the role(s) that need to be removed when a user is given access; comma separate roles for multiple roles to be removed (eg. ["012345678901234567", "765432109876543210"])
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation
To install all dependencies required by the bot, run `npm install` in the root directory. Node v16.9.0 or higher is required.

## Need help?
This bot was created for the use of [vEXS](https://vexs.uk), a virtual airline hosted on vAMSYS that simulates the real world operations of Jet2.com.
